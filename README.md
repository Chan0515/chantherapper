- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development currently; not entirely sure the direction I want to go yet.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build an NBA Fantasy Basketball web app using Django REST Framework for the backend and React for the frontend. The app will be focused on utilizing statistics to optimize Fantasy teams based on relative categorical value.
